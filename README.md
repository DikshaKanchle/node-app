# 🐳 Assignment 2 – Multi-Stage Dockerfile (Node.js)

## 📘 Objective
Build a minimal runtime Docker image for a Node.js application using **multi-stage builds**.

---

## 📁 Project Structure
```
node-app/
├── app.js
├── package.json
├── Dockerfile
└── README.md
```

---

## ⚙️ Step 1: Simple Node.js App
The app starts a basic HTTP server on **port 3000** and returns a simple message.

**app.js**
```js
const http = require('http');
const port = 3000;
const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.end('Hello from Docker Multi-Stage Build!');
});
server.listen(port, () => console.log(`Running on port ${port}`));
```

---

## 🧱 Step 2: Multi-Stage Dockerfile
This Dockerfile uses **two stages**:
1. **Builder Stage** – installs dependencies.
2. **Runtime Stage** – copies only the necessary files to make the image lightweight.

**Dockerfile**
```dockerfile
# Stage 1: Build stage
FROM node:18 AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .

# Stage 2: Runtime stage
FROM node:18-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app .
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["node", "app.js"]
```

---

## 🏗️ Step 3: Build and Run Docker Image

### 🧩 Build Image
```bash
docker build -t multi-stage-node .
```

### ▶️ Run Container
```bash
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 multi-stage-node
```

### 🌐 Test Application
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000
```
Expected Output:
```
Hello from Docker Multi-Stage Build!
```

---

## 📊 Step 4: Compare Image Sizes

| Build Type        | Command                        | Image Size |
|-------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|
| Single-Stage Build | `docker build -t single .`     | Larger (~1GB) |
| Multi-Stage Build  | `docker build -t multi .`      | Smaller (~200MB) |

📸 **Screenshot Required:**  
Take a screenshot of `docker images` showing both image sizes.

---

## ✅ Expected Screenshots
- `docker images` size comparison  
- Running container output (`curl http://localhost:3000`)  
- Dockerfile code snippet  

---

## 🧾 Notes
- Multi-stage builds reduce final image size by removing unnecessary build files.  
- `node:18-slim` is used for a smaller runtime environment.  
- Exposed port **3000** is used to access the application in browser:  
  **http://localhost:3000**

---

## 🏁 Conclusion
Using multi-stage builds significantly reduces Docker image size and improves deployment efficiency.  
This project demonstrates how to build, run, and optimize a Node.js Docker container.
